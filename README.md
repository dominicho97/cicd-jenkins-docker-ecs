**Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD**) Pipeline for **Dockerized** Applications on **AWS**


This project focuses on implementing a robust CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins for building, packaging, and deploying Docker images to Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Container Registry (ECR) and subsequently deploying them to AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS).

## Benefits:

Time and Cost Savings: Automation reduces manual intervention, minimizing errors and accelerating the deployment process.
Consistency and Reliability: Ensures consistency in the deployment process across different environments, reducing the risk of discrepancies.
Enhanced Collaboration: Enables collaboration among development, testing, and operations teams by providing a standardized and automated deployment pipeline.
